# IFT6390-A-A20:  Fundamentals of machine learning 
[Class Website](https://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6390-ml-class/)
Machine learning is a very exciting discipline, but requires building upon some important skills. Before we begin, you should possess good knowlegde of:

Python programming is mandatory. You cannot use a different programming language in the class.
Linear algebra
Probability
The pace is meant to be intensive and the homework and exam requirements are going to be tough. As a result, if you have not mastered those three required skills, you should work on them first. This class will not teach you the required math or programming, but you will need them to pass the class.

As an indication, students who took the class in 2019 reported that to keep up with the classâ€™s needs, they worked on average:

* 12 hours per week, if they had already mastered the 3 prerequisites above
* 18 hours per week, if they had this knowledge, but needed to refresh it as we went along
* 25+ hours a week if they had serious gaps in some prerequisite
